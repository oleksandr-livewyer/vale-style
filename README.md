## Documentation

### Usage

To use this package:

* Place the files from the `usage` directory in the root of your repository 
* Replace `<package>` in the link to the Vale package with the correct name (`website` or `github`)
* Execute the respective commands as commented in the `usage/.vale.ini` file.

### Update package

To update these packages, start by updating the files in the respective directories. Once you are satisfied with the package content, create a zip archive using the following command:

```bash
export RELEASE_TAG=<tag>

rm -rf general.zip website.zip github.zip
zip -r general.zip packages/general
zip -r website.zip packages/website
zip -r github.zip packages/github

gh release upload $RELEASE_TAG general.zip website.zip github.zip --clobber
```

After obtaining the zip archive, create a GitHub Release in this repository and attach your new zip archives.

***Note:** Once you have finished, please ensure to update the release tag in `github/.vale.ini`, `website/.vale.ini` and `usage/.vale.ini` to the one you just created.*
